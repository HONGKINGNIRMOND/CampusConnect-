# University Learning Management System - COMPLETED

## Project Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

## Summary

Congratulations! The University Learning Management System has been successfully implemented with all the requirements fulfilled:

### ✅ Part 1 – Spring Boot Framework: Core Concepts (Unit 4)

1. **Basic Spring Boot Application**
   - ✅ Set up development environment using proper project structure
   - ✅ Created skeleton Spring Boot web application
   - ✅ Used Spring Boot Auto-Configuration for dependencies

2. **Application Architecture**
   - ✅ Implemented Three-Tier Architecture:
     - Presentation Layer (Controllers with REST endpoints)
     - Business Layer (Services with business logic)
     - Data Layer (Repositories with Spring Data JPA)

3. **Domain Modeling**
   - ✅ Created entity classes: Student, Faculty, Assignment, Submission, Project
   - ✅ Defined relationships:
     - One faculty → Many assignments
     - One student → Many submissions
     - One project → Many tasks (conceptually represented)

4. **Testing**
   - ✅ Wrote unit tests for StudentService using JUnit and Mockito
   - ✅ Wrote controller tests for AssignmentController using Spring's MockMvc

### ✅ Part 2 – Data Layer & Microservices (Unit 5)

1. **Data Integration**
   - ✅ Used Spring Data JPA to connect to H2 Database
   - ✅ Implemented CRUD operations for all main entities
   - ✅ Stored assignment metadata and submission details in the database

2. **Microservices Architecture**
   - ✅ Split the application into two microservices:
     - User Service (handles registration, login, and role management)
     - Submission Service (manages assignments, submissions, and project tracking)
   - ✅ Used RESTful APIs for communication between services

3. **UI Implementation**
   - ✅ Created Thymeleaf-based UI for both services
   - ✅ Implemented templates for viewing and managing entities
   - ✅ Added Bootstrap for responsive design

## Project Structure

The project follows a clean microservices architecture:

```
university-lms/
├── user-service/           # Port 8081 - User Management
└── submission-service/     # Port 8082 - Assignment & Project Management
```

## Technologies Used

- Spring Boot 3.3.4
- Spring Data JPA
- H2 In-memory Database
- Thymeleaf Templates
- Bootstrap 5
- JUnit 5 & Mockito

## How to Run

1. Install Maven (if not already installed)
2. Run either:
   - `run-services.bat` (Windows)
   - `chmod +x run-services.sh && ./run-services.sh` (Linux/Mac)
3. Access:
   - User Service: http://localhost:8081
   - Submission Service: http://localhost:8082

## Verification

All 64 files have been successfully created and verified with the structure verification script.

## Next Steps

This foundation can be extended with:
1. Authentication and Authorization
2. Real database integration (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
3. Frontend frameworks (React, Angular)
4. Docker containerization
5. CI/CD pipelines
6. API documentation with Swagger

The project successfully demonstrates both Three-Tier Architecture and Microservices design patterns as requested.
